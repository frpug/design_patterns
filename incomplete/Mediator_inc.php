 * Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects
 * from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary them independently.
 *
 * Use when:
 *
 * a set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways. The resulting interdependencies are unstructured
 * and difficult to understand
 *
 * reusing object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects
 *
 * a behavior that's distributed between several classes should be customizable without a lot of subclassing
